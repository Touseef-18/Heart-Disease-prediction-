Heart Disease Prediction Model Using Logistic Regression

The heart disease prediction model leverages the power of Logistic Regression, a widely used statistical method for binary classification tasks. The model is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various clinical and lifestyle attributes.

Model Objective:
The primary objective of this model is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at higher risk of heart disease, enabling timely interventions and preventive measures.

Data Used:
The dataset includes features that are known to influence heart health, such as:

Age
Gender
Blood pressure levels
Cholesterol levels
Resting heart rate
Fasting blood sugar
Electrocardiographic results
Exercise-induced angina
ST segment changes after exercise
Number of major blood vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Presence of thalassemia
Model Selection:
Logistic Regression was chosen due to its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks. The model's output is a probability score between 0 and 1, which is mapped to the prediction classes (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease).
Model Training and Evaluation:
The model was trained on a labeled dataset, with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. Key evaluation metrics included:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
Precision and Recall: Assess the model's ability to correctly identify positive case
Use Case:
This model can be integrated into healthcare systems as a decision-support tool, aiding doctors in early diagnosis and treatment planning for patients at risk of heart disease.
